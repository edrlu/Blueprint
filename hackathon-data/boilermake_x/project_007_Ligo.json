Like 1 Comment Story Updates The Problem Currently, there is no way for events at a large scale such as conventions, premieres, events, and even hackathons to track their carbon footprint. However, by measuring the number of plastics, waste, and sustainable options they have, we can understand their impact. Therefore, we have created Ligo, a tool to track an event and its attendees' carbon footprint. How we built it üèÑüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Our tech stack includes SvelteKit MongoDB TailwindCSS To deploy, we used Vercel, with the .tech domain with Domain.com. Challenges üòµ‚Äçüí´ Using Sveltekit was a challenge! It's a new framework for everyone on our team, and while we're used to the typical MERN stack, we had to do a throwback to just plain vanilla javascript for Ligo. Deploying our site was a setback for a while, but we fixed bug after bug and managed to pull through! Using SQL with CockroachDB challenged our SQL competency, and while it was a very rewarding experience, we unfortunately switched to MongoDB at the very end due to issues with SSL. Reflections üìö ‚ú® We pulled through with a completely new tech stack and learned about some of the benefits that Sveltekit has to offer. The very nature of this project forced us to look around for what sustainable and unsustainable habits we take for granted Built With javascriptmongodbsveltekittailwindcssvercel Try it out github.com www.ligoismore.tech Submitted to BoilerMake X Winner Best Water, Food, Health, or Climate Hack Winner MLH: Best Domain Name Using Domain.com Created by Ellie Popoca Information Science @ UIUC Jamie Rollison CS @ UIUC Liza George Like 1 1 person likes this: Share this project: Updates Ellie Popoca started this project ‚Äî Jan 22, 2023 03:37 AM EST Leave feedback in the comments!
