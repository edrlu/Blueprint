The system is designed to operate in low-power environments and cover long distances, ensuring that essential communication can still occur when it is most needed. A key feature of this network is the integration of a \"super\" node equipped with satellite connectivity (via Skylo), which serves as the bridge between local nodes and a centralized server. The server processes the data and sends SMS notifications through Twilio to the intended recipients. Importantly, the system provides acknowledgment back to the originating node, confirming successful delivery of the message. This solution is aimed at enabling individuals to notify loved ones or emergency responders during critical times, such as natural disasters, when conventional communication channels are down. Project Inspiration The inspiration for Resililink came from personal experiences of communication outages during hurricanes. In each instance, we found ourselves cut off from vital resources like the internet, making it impossible to check on family members, friends, or receive updates on the situation. These moments of helplessness highlighted the urgent need for a resilient communication network that could function even when the usual infrastructure fails. System Capabilities Resililink is designed to be resilient, easy to deploy, and scalable, with several key features: Ease of Deployment: The network is fast to set up, making it particularly useful in emergency situations. Dual Connectivity: It allows communication both across the internet and in peer-to-peer fashion over long ranges, ensuring continuous data flow even in remote areas. Cost-Efficiency: The nodes are inexpensive to produce, as each consists of a single LoRa radio and an ESP32 microcontroller, keeping hardware costs to a minimum. Development Approach The development of Resililink involved creating a custom communication protocol based on Protocol Buffers (protobufs) to efficiently manage data exchange. The core hardware components include LoRa radios, which provide long-range communication, and Skylo satellite connectivity, enabling nodes to transmit data to the internet using the MQTT protocol. On the backend, a server hosted on Microsoft Azure handles the incoming MQTT messages, decrypts them, and forwards the relevant information to appropriate APIs, such as Twilio, for further processing and notification delivery. This seamless integration of satellite technology and cloud infrastructure ensures the reliability and scalability of the system. Key Challenges Several challenges arose during the development process. One of the most significant issues was the lack of clear documentation for the AT commands on the Mutura evaluation board, which made it difficult to implement some of the core functionalities. Additionally, given the low-level nature of the project, debugging was particularly challenging, requiring in-depth tracing of system operations to identify and resolve issues. Another constraint was the limited packet size of 256 bytes, necessitating careful optimization to ensure efficient use of every byte of data transmitted. Achievements Despite these challenges, we successfully developed a fully functional network, complete with a working demonstration. The system proved capable of delivering messages over long distances with low power consumption, validating the concept and laying the groundwork for future enhancements. Lessons Learned Through this project, we gained a deeper understanding of computer networking, particularly in the context of low-power, long-range communication technologies like LoRa. The experience also provided valuable insights into the complexities of integrating satellite communication with terrestrial mesh networks. Future Plans for Resililink Looking ahead, we plan to explore ways to scale the network, focusing on enhancing its reliability and expanding its reach to serve larger geographic areas. We are also interested in further refining the underlying protocol and exploring new applications for Resililink beyond disaster recovery scenarios, such as in rural connectivity or industrial IoT use cases.
