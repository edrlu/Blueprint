Like 5 Comment 1 Story Updates 1 Donation Landing Page Inspiration We were inspired by how there were many instances of fraud with regards to how donations were handled. It is heartbreaking to see how mismanagement can lead to victims of disasters not receiving the help that they desperately need. What it does TrustTrace introduces unparalleled levels of transparency and accountability to charities and fundraisers. Donors will now feel more comfortable donating to causes such as helping earthquake victims since they will now know how their money will be spent, and where every dollar raised is going to. How we built it We created a smart contract that allowed organisations to specify how much money they want to raise and how they want to segment their spending into specific categories. This is then enforced by the smart contract, which puts donors at ease as they know that their donations will not be misused, and will go to those who are truly in need. Challenges we ran into The integration of smart contracts and the web development frameworks were more difficult than we expected, and we overcame them with lots of trial and error. Accomplishments that we're proud of We are proud of being able to create this in under 36 hours for a noble cause. We hope that this creation can eventually evolve into a product that can raise interest, trust, and participation in donating to humanitarian causes across the world. What we learned We learnt a lot about how smart contract works, how they are deployed, and how they can be used to enforce trust. What's next for TrustTrace Expanding towards serving a wider range of fundraisers such as GoFundMes, Kickstarters, etc. Built With javascriptmongodbreactsolidity Try it out github.com Submitted to HackHarvard 2023 Winner 3rd Best Overall Hack Created by Shermaine Ong Sean Manik Bozheng (Eric) Zhang Gareth Ong Like 5 5 people like this: Share this project: Updates Bozheng (Eric) Zhang posted an update — Oct 22, 2023 05:15 AM EDT I hesitated on donating money after the Turkey earthquake, but with this I'm much more confident that my money will end up helping those in need.
