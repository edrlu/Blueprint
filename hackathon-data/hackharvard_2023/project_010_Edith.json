Beyond Dates, Into Well-Being. Like 2 Comment Story Updates Vision Dashboard Dashboard the spotify api ui Inspiration Answer: Our increasingly complex lives demand more than just a reminder tool; they need an understanding partner. We witnessed the strain of juggling health, work, academic responsibilities, and social lives. This inspired the creation of Edith – a comprehensive, intuitive, and health-conscious planner. What it does Answer: Edith is an intelligent calendar that not only plans your day but also considers your health, stress levels, and preferences. Through integration with multiple APIs, it suggests Spotify playlists for stress, plans academic tasks, offers horoscope-based guidance, allows conversational planning, and even suggests activities based on the weather. It's a complete, holistic approach to daily planning. How we built it Answer: Edith is a product of diverse API integrations. By harnessing the power of Terra API for health metrics, Spotify API for mood music, Canvas/Blackboard for academic commitments, Horoscope for celestial insights, OpenAI for chat-based planning, and Weather APIs, we developed a cohesive, user-friendly application. Our team utilized agile development, ensuring regular iterations and refinements based on user feedback. Challenges we ran into Answer: Combining multiple API integrations seamlessly was our primary challenge. Ensuring real-time updates while maintaining the app's speed and responsiveness required optimized backend solutions. Also, refining Edith's AI to offer genuinely useful, not overwhelming, suggestions was a careful balancing act. Accomplishments that we're proud of Answer: We are immensely proud of Edith's ability to \"understand\" individual users. Its adaptive learning and predictive capabilities set it apart from conventional planners. Our beta testing showed a significant reduction in users' reported stress levels and an increase in their daily productivity. What we learned Answer: We learned the importance of user-centric design. By conducting surveys and continuous feedback loops, we understood the real needs of our audience. Technically, we also grasped the nuances of integrating diverse APIs to work harmoniously within a singular platform. What's next for Edith Answer: We envision expanding Edith's capabilities with more integrations, like fitness trackers and meal planning tools. We're also looking into developing a community feature, allowing users to share tips, strategies, and success stories, fostering a supportive Edith community.
