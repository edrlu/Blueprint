Students enter their preferences, and our website shows them colleges where they best fit. Like 3 Comment Story Updates Inspiration Deciding where to go to college is tough. When you're a student it seems like there is an endless list of universities to choose from. As students ourselves, we know what it feels like. Our goal is to provide easy, accessible information to students all around the world. With College Collage, discovering where you belong is easy. What it does College Collage allows users to enter their preferences regarding various aspects of colleges. Then, it compares their preferences with over a thousand colleges and returns the top 5 colleges that match their preferences. It displays the colleges with relevant information such as location and tuition in an aesthetically pleasing collage. How we built it We used the Python Flask framework for the backend, where we receive and parse user input. Additionally, we clean and transform a dataset that contains over 1000 colleges and certain statistics. Then, we used cosine similarity to compare user input with those colleges and score them based on how similar they are. Finally, we ranked the colleges based on fit and sent the information back to Flask to display on the website. Challenges we ran into One of the biggest challenges we had was finding data. Initially, we wanted to find a dataset that contained a significant amount of students and their respective colleges so that we could train a supervised learning classifier to predict the best college for a specific user input. After we realized that this data was not readily made available, we decided to use a different dataset that contained general information about colleges. Accomplishments that we're proud of We are proud of our final product, and we hope to continue improving and building it in the future. We came into this hackathon wanting to make something that is impactful and functional. It was a lot of hard work, no sleep, and lots of debugging. However, we persevered and we are happy with our finished product. What we learned We learned how to use Flask on the backend. Additionally, we gained more experience in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and machine learning. What's next for College Collage We hope to improve the website by adding more preferences, developing new ways to find relevant data, and incorporate new features to the recommendation system. Built With beautiful-soupcssflaskhtml5javascriptnumpypandaspythonscikit-learn Try it out github.com Submitted to HackNYU 2023 Winner Track: Education Created by I helped to collect and curate the data that was used in our recommendation system. I also helped to design and worked on the recommendation system, itself. The processing and testing was all carried out in Jupyter Notebook. alex dong I worked on the backend using Flask. It was my first time using Flask but I enjoyed it. It was interesting to see how HTML/CSS/JS is used in conjunction with Python, which was something I wanted to understand. Olivia Lee I worked on building the recommendation system in Python. It was a challenge to work with the data, but I think it was rewarding to see how well our system worked when we finished!
