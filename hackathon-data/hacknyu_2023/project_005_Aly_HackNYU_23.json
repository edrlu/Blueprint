Like 21 Comment Story Updates Keeping you accountable, one awkward text at a time, Aly is an app, website, and chrome extension that serves a tool for users to hold themselves accountable. Inspiration After finishing our first semester of college, we found it difficult on certain days to go to class and staying focused while studying. While there are other apps that help you focus, we didn't like how they were locked behind a paywall or how they completely blocked certain apps. Our solution was to make Aly an app that embarrasses the user if they aren't on task by sending texts to their friends/parents. What it does Database syncing activity over website, app, and chrome extension. Uses machine learning to scan webpages to see if you're staying focused. Functionality to add multiple different tasks on a mobile app with a user-friendly and responsive interface. How we built it App: Our app was built using React Native, JavaScript, Firebase, and Apple Maps. Chrome Extension: Javascript Website: The website was built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Chakra UI. Challenges we ran into We were overly ambitious trying to accomplish everything in 21 hours so we had to compromise at the end on some of the things we wanted to do. The ones who developed our app had also never touched app development before so it was their first time using React Native. In addition, we were also just a bit mentally fatigued because we flew in from Minnesota on Thursday and walked over 50k steps exploring New York in the past two days. Accomplishments that we're proud of We think that this project is one of our best works in terms of polish and product. In addition, a lot of the work we did was split evenly and it really felt like we wouldn't have been able to do it if we weren't in a team together. What we learned Having mozzarella sticks when you're lactose is not a good idea and 21 hours goes by very fast... On a serious note, we learned that React Native is rather painful to work with, but we're glad to have gotten experience with app development! What's next for Aly Polish up on the components we had to skip over due to time restrictions. Implement a system to lower strike count, probably with a streak of 7 removing 1 strike. Fun Fact While we were about to submit our project, our chrome extension noticed that we swapped off from our calculus videos to Devpost and Aly noticed that we were off topic and sent a text to one of our friends.
