Introducing AskAnon! Get answers from your professor during lecture without any of the fear to ask. Like 1 Comment Story Updates Session selection screen Empty session room User POV Professor POV Emojis Firebase Dashboard Auth0 Dashboard Auth0 Signin Inspiration This semester in Deep Learning, our professor Dr. Cowan was noticing a lot of people weren't asking questions. As an experiment he started posting a google document to be used in class so people could anonymously ask questions. It's been a complete success all semester and engagement has been through the roof. We're hoping that by providing a platform that professors can use during lecture to allow students to anonymously ask questions, students will feel more inclined to participate and ask questions. What it does AskAnon allows verified professors in Rutgers to create chat sessions. Creating a session generates a unique session ID that students can enter on the site to join the lecture chat and ask questions without the fear of asking a \"stupid question\". How we built it We utilized the next.js framework to create the site with Firebase as our database to store a session's message history along with new messages. Auth0 is used to allow users and professors to login, along with verifying a professor so they are able to create sessions. Auth0 also lets us verify that users are using the Rutgers email domain. Challenges we ran into We originally wanted to implement class polls so that the professor could generate a poll and have the entire class vote on it. However due to the time constraint we were unable to implement this feature. We also ran into a near last minute disaster in which we exceeded our quota on Firebase and could not load any rooms or messages but were fortunate enough to spin up and configure a new Firebase app right before the submission was due. Accomplishments that we're proud of Within a small time span we were able to completely implement a web app that allows professors to create a chatting room for their students. This felt very ambitious due to the backend and frontend requirements along with us being a team of 2. What we learned There's a lot that goes into the development of any web app with a basic chatting functionality. To correctly store and display user messages in multiple rooms requires careful planning along with a reasonable amount of time. What's next for AskAnon Adding classroom polls, question threads, reacting to other user's messages, and more admin privileges such as muting and banning users.
