We wished there was something to help, so we set out to create it ourselves. What it does We created a chrome extension that gives you a notification if you are slouching or don't have good posture. We keep track of your posture score and motivate you to take care of your back! How we built it We used AWS to train and deploy our model. We created a chrome extension with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Challenges we ran into Setting up AWS and training with SageMaker. Accomplishments that we're proud of Setting up AWS and training with SageMaker.
