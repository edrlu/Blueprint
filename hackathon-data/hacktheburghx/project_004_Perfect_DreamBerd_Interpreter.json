(Maybe) the world's first distributed cloud-based interpreter. Includes a novel type-checking system and `const const const` support. Like Comment Story Updates System architecture Inspiration The DreamBerd spec can be found here - this will explain a lot... and also very little. How we built it (Badly.) Language included: Scala, Perl, Go, JavaScript, Rust, Dockerfile. The main components are: Entry bash script (could be replaced with a cloud entrypoint) REPL (Go) LLM type-checking (JS) Parser (Perl) Eval (Scala) Const-const-const server (Rust) Challenges we ran into Unfamiliarity with the languages we were using, the language we were interpreting, and the deliberately ridiculous system architecture made this even more challenging than we thought. Accomplishments that we're proud of We did manage to achieve some cool stuff - with some of the components working properly :) Some of our team also made it to Big Cheese, and got back to work upon their return. What we learned We all learned new programming languages (which we all enjoyed doing)! What's next for Perfect DreamBerd Interpreter Make it work, and full DreamBerd spec-compliance. Would be nice to get a proper Kubernetes deployment (incl. load balancing) going once each component has been successfully Docker-ised - we got close but not quite there! Built With bashdockergojavascriptperlrustscala Try it out github.com Submitted to HackTheBurgh X Winner Hackiest Hack Created by I wrote a REPL for the DreamBerd interpreter which can read a file for DreamBerd code and pass it to a Bash shell. This was my first time working with Go and I thoroughly enjoyed working with it. I expect I will use my experience with Go in future projects requiring a command line interface.
