Upload your receipts, view your fridge and pantry lists, and get recipe ideas; all with the FoodFriend app. Like Comment Story Updates The main pantry and fridge lists The recipe page Inspiration Are you ever at the store and don't remember if you have milk left at home? Do you forget your veg at the back of the fridge and need a recipe to use them before they spoil? FoodFriend comes to the rescue. What it does FoodFriend lets you upload pictures of your receipts and selectively adds the food items you have bought to your fridge foods and pantry foods lists. You can check these when you're at the store, to see what you have and what you are missing. FoodFriend tells you how many days you've had each item, and lets you select foods to make recipes--an easy way to get rid of those pesky leftovers! How we built it The application relies on Tesseract OCR (optical character recognition) to scan the receipt images, then feeds them through a locally installed llama2 LLM (large language model) to filter out food entries, decide what needs to go into the fridge, and parse those confusing receipt entries into simple English. The front-end is built using PyQt6. Accomplishments that we're proud of We developed this as a humble team of two in twelve hours! What's next for FoodFriend We are focused on scalability. The next step is to develop a web app, so you can use FoodFriend on the go. We also want to add family accounts so everyone living under the same roof and sharing food can have access to what is in the fridge and the pantry when they are shopping, eliminating the need for those \"Did you get milk?\" texts.
