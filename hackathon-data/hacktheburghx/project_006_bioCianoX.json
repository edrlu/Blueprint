We were inspired by our grandparents' difficulties accessing medical assistance, and our worries when unable to monitor their health while away at university. What it does A wearable set of biometric sensors collect and send data to the bioCianoX web app, where it is processed and displayed in a dashboard. The patient and authorized users can view this data. In case the biometric data reaches critical levels, an emergency alert is sent to authorized users. All users have limited time to respond to the emergency alert, after which emergency services are contacted. How we built it The ESP8622 microcontroller is connected to a waterproof DS18B20-Compatible temperature sensor and a ECG sensor. The data they collect is continuously sent to the bioCianoX backend, where it is processed and then displayed in the frontend as a dashboard The patient and authorized users can view this data if they are logged in. In case the biometric data reaches critical levels, an emergency alert is sent to authorized users to their personal devices. All users have limited time to respond to the emergency alert, after which emergency services are contacted. Challenges we ran into Setting up the firmware for the brand new ESP8622 and also trying to acquire an ECG sensor during the hackathon. Setting up the network connection for the ESP8622 microcontroller. Accomplishments that we're proud of bioCianoX can monitor temperature, ECG and pulse rate. What we learned Kat: new microcontroller technology, wifi-enabled microcontrollers, how to use ECG and temperature sensors Johnny: how to install firmware for a microcontroller and interact with it What's next for bioCianoX wireless health monitor Building a more compact circuit and adding more biometric sensors to make the telehealth monitor more wearable Improved patient privacy and data security Built With flaskkitonemicropythonreact Try it out github.com Submitted to HackTheBurgh X Winner Best Use of Kintone Created by I worked on the front and backend of the web application.
