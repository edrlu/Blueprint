Like 2 Comment Story Updates Inspiration Conway's game of life, Infinite Crafter, and Agar.io and Club Penguin (all the classics) What it does An extensible, free-for-all sandbox playground, where players work together to build the universe! You are a player on a blank canvas. Work together with other players to create new blocks from existing ones. New discoveries are generated by ChatGPT, so the game can go on forever! How we built it With bloody, toil, sweat and tears. We wrote a Rust backend to talk to the Godot frontend over Websockets and used a Go caching server to reduce our already sizable OpenAI bill. The software is deployed on a self hosted Kubernetes cluster and uses a Postgres database for persistence. Nginx and Azure static web apps are used for load balancing and static serving. This has been built with extensibility in mind from the start. If the server runs out of memory we can start another cluster. All OpenAI requests (and DALL-e requests for textures) are cached, so that the more people play the game, the bigger it gets. This also allows for fast results, and a consistent gameplay experience. Challenges we ran into Danny had a typo in his API key. It took 3 hours to debug! We had to do some hacky fixes Accomplishments that we're proud of Performant architecture, ready to scale as new players join. A unique and creative gameplay loop. What we learned Netcode is hard :( Games are hard :( Everyone wants to rate limit us. What's next for CosmicKube Scale it to the moon. More Kubernetes!! Built With dockergogodotjenkinskubernetesnginxopenaipostgresqlrust Try it out happy-ground-01a840003.4.azurestaticapps.net github.com hack.djpiper28.co.uk Submitted to HackTheBurgh X Winner GameDev Co-Op Winner System Administration Mastery Created by I created the Rust Websocket code and worked on the server-side game logic. This was my first time writing a program of this scale in Rust! I am a frontend developer by trade so this was outside of my comfort zone but I found it super fun. I had to design systems for a deterministic game communications system where the server is truth. Charlotte is my debugging bestie I also drew the little main character fella Steph Flower worked on creating all the ci/cd pipelines (on GH actions and Jenkins) to automate deployment, as well architecting the netcode between the client and server. Leo Durrant expert at sleeping, and drinking tea Provisioned some Kubernetes, Postgres and Jenkins stuff on my server. made the AI caching server. made many typos. Danny Piper Software Engineer at Motorola Solutions; home-lab enjoyer; enjoys writing Go, C, C++, Python. HATES writing JS/TS.
