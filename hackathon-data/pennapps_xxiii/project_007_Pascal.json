Like 3 Comment Story Updates Inspiration What if you could carbon-neutral with 1-click? With the abundance of carbon offsets and credits available in recent years, the potential for individuals and businesses to lower their carbon footprint to net-zero has never been higher. But the biggest hurdle for many is the commitment to measure and offset their emissions on a regular basis. What it does Pascal is a tool for you to offset your carbon emissions to net-zero in 1-click. Pascal works with three simple steps: Connect your bank account via Plaid Measure your carbon footprint Automatically offset your carbon emissions As new transactions come in, Pascal will update your carbon footprint and offsets accordingly. How we built it We take your daily transaction data and convert it to CO2e data. For example, converting a $30 Uber ride to kg CO2e* For non-public vendors or merchants, we apply ML models using scientifically determined benchmark factors After aggregating your carbon contribution, we’ll enable you to either a) purchase individual carbon offsets from a broad selection of offset providers, b) enroll in automatic payments to offset a set percentage of your carbon emissions, or c) view recommendations for lower carbon intensive products/services to substitute your top emitting merchants. *To compute CO2e data conversions, we utilize a variety of data sources including emissions disclosures and financial SEC filings. Challenges and Accomplishments A core challenge was automating the process of sourcing carbon offsets, which requires integrating with the APIs of several marketplaces. Another challenge was utilizing Plaid to integrate live with the user’s bank transaction data. What's next for Pascal In the future, we will launch Pascal by partnering with banks to integrate Pascal’s APIs and UI into enterprise and commercial banking applications (e.g. Chase Mobile App).
