Like 6 Comment 2 Story Updates Inspiration Our inspiration for SustainaGO was found when we realized there needs to be more conscious decisions to make when traveling as college students. Climate change is an important issue that many of the younger generation feel a strong desire to fix before it is past the point of no return. With this in mind, as we continue our adventures in life, we want others to be able to make environmentally sustainable decisions when touring different places within the states. What it does SustainaGO helps users connect with the environment around them especially when touring new cities during travel. Instead of suggesting tourist traps that gain mass traction leading to over-tourism, our app will suggest more national parks and small locally funded events that are eco-friendly and raise awareness. There is a community tab to help build countless connections with not only your community but with strangers from around the states who wish to gain more exposure to their town/city. Not only can users find new events from here, but they can also add them directly to their future itinerary when planning to visit the city in the near future. Another key feature of our app is the How we built it We used Figma to help prototype and envision the app's future potential. Challenges we ran into One of the challenges we had was coming up with an idea and narrowing it down to help a specific need. We also were a group of not only two new beginner members to the hackathon world that had much to learn and become accustomed to the environment here. Another challenge we faced was creating a code that would work with our Figma prototype. Accomplishments that we're proud of We were successfully able to create a complete Figma prototype outlining the entire app's look and design. We made sure the ideas in our prototype fit all user's needs when traveling to new cities or old ones. What we learned As a group, we were able to do a lot of research on the effects of climate change and over-tourism. The concept of over-tourism is quite new and is defined by World Tourism Organization as \"the impact of tourism on a destination, or parts thereof, that excessively influences perceived quality of life of citizens and/or quality of visitors experiences in a negative way.\" What's next for SustainaGO With the sample database we were working on, we want to implement more data analytics into the app to show more visualization and appeal to a greater audience. We also want to create more code that will work hand in hand with the prototype created.
