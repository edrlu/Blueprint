Well, a big reason is discrimination and we are here to inform you about it and give recognition to local artists! Like 3 Comment 2 Story Updates Inspiration We both bonded over our shared love of music and this was a passion project to give recognition to unknown and local artists. What it does MUJAND can be used for many things like entertainment etc but its most important use is to teach people about different cultures and music all over the world. How we built it We used CSS,HTML and Javascript. Challenges we ran into The most challenging by far was the website design and the CSS arose many difficulties especially with the placing but fortunately we were successful at the end. Accomplishments that we're proud of We are really proud to be able to complete this website within the time limit. What we learned We learnt many things like creating a random generator and an interactive map but most importantly we improved our time managing skills. What's next for MUJAND We want to add new interactive features and complete our artist list. Built With csshtmljavascript Try it out super-amazing-project.alesiaisaraj.repl.co Submitted to Technica 2023 Winner Best Beginner Hack (Middle & High School) Created by Our workload was evenly distributed and we both worked on the HTML and CSS Alesia Isaraj Zineb jakib Like 3 3 people like this: Share this project: Updates Zineb jakib started this project — Oct 22, 2023 11:12 AM EDT Leave feedback in the comments!
