Skyward is a fun productivity hack meant to help you track your wellness, promote education and organize your life in a fun game! It is a chrome extension connected to a website that displays your very own skyscraper. The game can either be set to an individual mode where you are competing with your friends to build the tallest skyscraper fastest or a team mode where you and your friends are trying to build your skyscraper all the way up to the moon! Once your skyscraper is complete for the day you can share your progress or what stage you achieved. We created this game hack to encourage people to prioritize their mental health as well as ensure their productivity. With both settings, the environment can be as competitive as you want. This hack motivates people to be productive, something we as overwhelmed students appreciate. What it does Skyward uses your schedule to give you AI-generated to-do tasks and wellness ideas. As you complete tasks, your skyscraper gains more and more floors, eventually reaching space and even the moon to motivate you to keep up your productivity. After downloading the Skyward Chrome Extension, users are prompted to enter your activities and interests. Then, a to-do list is generated and a beginning, 1-story building is shown. When you check off a task, a new task replaces it and more stories are added to the skyscraper, depending on the importance of the task. Achievements are earned along the way to add extra motivation. Features Levels and Achievements - Gamifying a to-do list so that completing assignments is as fun as constructing the tallest skyscraper Chrome Extension - Access Skyward via a Chrome extension so that your goals are never out of reach Competitive/Non-Competitive - Two modes to help motivate individuals Recommended Wellness Activities - Utilizes ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo to recommend mental health wellness ideas How we built it We used JS, CSS, and HTML to make the Chrome Extension, and we used Notability to draw the logos and achievement pictures. We used ChatGPT to generate the prompts. Challenges we ran into We faced challenges in regards to integrating each other’s sections together. Allison worked on creating a ChatGPT 3.5 script that could take in a user’s interest and recommend 5 related wellness activities. A challenge we ran into was integrating the OpenAI API with the existing HTML/CSS/JS project for the Chrome Extension. We also had challenges dealing with security policies of Google Chrome extensions, since this limited how we could include JS in our HTML files. Accomplishments that we're proud of We are proud of our design and pictures, and how we were able to get each part to work by itself despite setbacks. What we learned Google Chrome Extension Developer - We learned how to link HTML/CSS/JS to run and test a Chrome Extension Implementing ChatGPT and AI - We learned how to use ChatGPT and OpenAI’s JS API in our project. Figma - We learned how to connect frames and create a simulation of the extension. What's next for Skyward We hope to solve our integration issues to provide a seamless AI powered scheduling experience. We want to improve our wellness suggestions — providing more relevant or accurate information based on data. We want our model to learn a persons’ priorities or preferences to provide a satisfactory schedule. We would like to add more interactions between users from competition to group goals. Another thing we want to build is more versions such as a mobile app for users to access their skyscrapers from anywhere. We also want to increase the scope of the skyscraper; from the moon to the galaxies and infinity and beyond!
