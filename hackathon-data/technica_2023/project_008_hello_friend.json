Like 5 Comment Story Updates conversation between multiple players pop quiz with feedback student in classroom chatroom Inspiration We were inspired by a friend of ours who missed almost a year of school because of an illness they were hospitalized for. They were cut off from the world outside and we were unable to communicate with people outside of written letters. Their online schooling experience was also unpleasant, as they had no interaction with teachers or other students. What it does It is a gamified school that allows users to choose a character to represent them, walk around the school into classrooms, and talk to teachers through a chat room. The teacher also has an interactive whiteboard that they can draw on. There are also other characters in the game who are students in similar situations and can interact and bond with each other. The teacher can also send out a pop quiz and this will notify the student in a pop-up window where they can complete the quiz. How we built it We used Unity 3D and C# in Visual Studio Code. Challenges we ran into The main challenge we ran into was combining features on different computers into one since we had tasks split up. Debugging was also an issue because we are relatively new to Unity. Accomplishments that we're proud of We are proud of the school environment we customized and the features of the game, like the interactive chat, whiteboard, and pop quiz windows. What we learned We learned how to use Unity and code in C#. What's next for hello, friend We plan on implementing a feature where the quizzes can be connected to Quizlet so teachers don't need to input questions manually. In addition, we want to add a talking feature where users can unmute and speak to each other rather than only using the chat.
