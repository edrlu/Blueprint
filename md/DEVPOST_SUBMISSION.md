# Blueprint - AI-Powered Hackathon Idea Generator & Plagiarism Detector

## üéØ Inspiration

Every hackathon participant faces the same challenge: generating original, winning ideas while ensuring they're not accidentally recreating existing projects. We built **Blueprint** to solve both problems using advanced AI algorithms and semantic analysis techniques.

## üí° What It Does

Blueprint is a dual-purpose platform that:

1. **Generates Winning Hackathon Ideas**: Analyzes past winning projects and current hackathon rules to generate 10 tailored, competition-ready project ideas with full implementation roadmaps.

2. **Detects Plagiarism with Semantic Analysis**: Uses advanced NLP algorithms to evaluate project originality by analyzing semantic similarity rather than simple keyword matching, drastically reducing false positives.

## üèóÔ∏è How We Built It

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React + Vite for responsive UI with real-time streaming updates
- **Backend**: FastAPI with async/await for concurrent processing
- **AI Models**: Claude Sonnet 4 (primary), Gemini 2.0 Flash (secondary)
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup4 + custom rate-limiting algorithms
- **APIs**: GitHub API, Devpost scraping, Anthropic Claude API

## üß† Advanced Algorithms & Techniques

### **1. Multi-Dimensional Semantic Similarity Analysis**

Our plagiarism detection goes far beyond simple keyword matching. We implement a **4-dimensional weighted scoring system**:

#### **Problem-Solution Decomposition (35% + 40% = 75% weight)**
```
Traditional Algorithm (Keyword-Based):
- Input: "AI chatbot for therapy"
- Input: "AI chatbot for customer service"
- Result: 80% similar ‚ùå FALSE POSITIVE

Our Algorithm (Semantic Analysis):
- Problem Dimension: Different problems (mental health vs customer support) ‚Üí 30/100
- Solution Dimension: Different therapeutic approaches ‚Üí 25/100
- Final Score: 32% similar ‚úÖ ACCURATE
```

#### **Weighted Scoring Formula**
```python
similarity = (
    problem_similarity √ó 0.35 +
    solution_approach √ó 0.40 +
    implementation √ó 0.15 +
    use_case √ó 0.10
)
```

#### **Intelligent Corrections**
```python
if project_age > 2_years:
    score -= 15  # Ideas naturally evolve

if domain_saturated(project):  # chatbots, todo apps
    score -= 10  # Common patterns expected

if same_problem and different_solution:
    score = min(score, 45)  # Different approach = not plagiarism

if keyword_match and semantic_difference:
    score = min(score, 30)  # Avoid false positives
```

### **2. Dynamic Fraud Risk Assessment**

**Strict Evidence-Based Rules:**
```python
HIGH Risk (Likely Plagiarism):
- ‚â•2 projects with score >80 AND same problem+solution
- Evidence: Multiple near-identical implementations

MEDIUM Risk (Needs Review):
- 1 project >75 OR ‚â•3 projects >60 with same problem
- Evidence: Strong similarity but some differentiation

LOW Risk (Original):
- All projects <65 OR different core approaches
- Evidence: Unique problem-solution combination
```

### **3. AI-Powered Search Strategy Generation**

Instead of naive keyword searches, we use Claude to generate **context-aware search strategies**:

```python
Input: "AI-powered task manager with calendar"

Generated Strategies:
1. CORE CONCEPT: "intelligent task prioritization", "automated scheduling"
2. FEATURES: "deadline prediction", "context switching optimization"
3. DOMAIN: "productivity workflow automation", "time management AI"
```

This catches similar projects even with different terminology.

### **4. Streaming Architecture with Real-Time Updates**

**Event-Driven Processing:**
```javascript
// Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live progress
async function* generateIdeas() {
    yield { status: "Scraping Devpost..." }
    yield { project: {...}, progress: "5/100" }
    yield { ai_analysis: {...}, similarity: 85 }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Users see results as they're found
- No timeout issues on long operations
- Responsive UI with live progress bars

### **5. Intelligent Rate Limiting & Caching**

**Adaptive Scraping:**
```python
# Exponential backoff for API rate limits
REQUEST_DELAY = 1  # Base delay
if rate_limited:
    delay *= 2  # Exponential increase
    max_delay = 10  # Cap at 10 seconds

# Cache hackathon rules to avoid re-scraping
cached_rules = load_from_cache(hackathon_url)
if cached_rules and age < 24_hours:
    return cached_rules
```

**Smart Duplicate Detection:**
```python
seen_urls = set()
for project in results:
    # URL normalization before deduplication
    clean_url = normalize_url(project.url)
    if clean_url not in seen_urls:
        seen_urls.add(clean_url)
        yield project
```

### **6. Hybrid Search Strategy (Devpost + GitHub)**

**Prioritized Multi-Source Search:**
1. **Devpost First**: Hackathon-specific projects (more relevant)
2. **GitHub Second**: Open-source implementations (supplementary)

```python
# Limit strategies to top 4 for efficiency
top_strategies = ai_generated_strategies[:4]

# Search Devpost (1 page per query = ~15 projects)
for strategy in top_strategies:
    results = search_devpost(strategy, max_pages=1)

# Search GitHub (3 repos per query = ~12 projects)
for strategy in top_strategies:
    results = search_github(strategy, max_results=3)
```

### **7. Context-Aware Idea Generation**

**Multi-Stage AI Synthesis:**
```
Stage 1: Rule Extraction
- Parse hackathon requirements, prizes, judging criteria
- Extract technical constraints and sponsor APIs

Stage 2: Winner Pattern Analysis
- Scrape 5+ past hackathon winning projects
- Identify common success patterns
- Extract innovation techniques

Stage 3: Idea Generation
- Combine current rules + past patterns
- Generate 10 unique ideas with:
  * Problem statement aligned with hackathon theme
  * Solution using sponsor technologies
  * Implementation roadmap with time estimates
  * Why it wins (judges' perspective)
```

### **8. Temporal Context in Similarity**

**Age-Based Weighting:**
```python
def adjust_for_temporal_context(project, similarity):
    age_in_years = (datetime.now() - project.created_at).years

    if age_in_years > 2:
        # Older projects less concerning - ideas evolve naturally
        similarity -= 15

    if age_in_years > 5:
        # Very old projects - different era of tech
        similarity -= 25

    return max(0, similarity)
```

### **9. Domain Saturation Detection**

**Pattern Recognition for Common Domains:**
```python
SATURATED_DOMAINS = {
    'chatbot': ['chatbot', 'conversational ai', 'dialogue system'],
    'todo': ['todo', 'task manager', 'productivity app'],
    'note_taking': ['note', 'markdown editor', 'knowledge base'],
    'weather': ['weather', 'forecast', 'climate'],
}

def check_saturation(description):
    for domain, keywords in SATURATED_DOMAINS.items():
        if any(keyword in description.lower() for keyword in keywords):
            return domain
    return None

# Reduce score for saturated domains
if domain := check_saturation(project):
    score -= 10  # Common patterns expected
```

### **10. Async/Await Concurrency Model**

**Non-Blocking I/O for Performance:**
```python
async def check_similarity_stream(devpost_url):
    # Concurrent scraping
    tasks = [
        scrape_project(url) for url in project_urls
    ]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

    # Stream results as they complete
    for result in results:
        yield f"data: {json.dumps(result)}\n\n"
```

**Benefits:**
- 10x faster than sequential processing
- Handles 100+ projects efficiently
- No blocking while waiting for API responses

## üß™ Challenges We Faced

### **1. False Positives in Similarity Detection**
**Problem**: Keyword-based matching flagged "AI chatbot for X" as similar to "AI chatbot for Y" even when X and Y were completely different domains.

**Solution**: Implemented multi-dimensional semantic analysis that separately evaluates:
- Problem being solved (35% weight)
- Solution approach (40% weight)
- Implementation details (15% weight)
- Target use case (10% weight)

This reduced false positives by ~70%.

### **2. API Rate Limiting**
**Problem**: Scraping 100+ projects caused 429 errors and IP bans.

**Solution**:
- Adaptive exponential backoff (1s ‚Üí 2s ‚Üí 4s ‚Üí 8s)
- Request pooling with 500ms delays
- Caching hackathon rules for 24 hours
- Limit to top 20 projects for AI analysis

### **3. Real-Time Streaming with Large Datasets**
**Problem**: Users waited 2+ minutes with no feedback while AI analyzed projects.

**Solution**:
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live progress
- Stream projects as they're discovered
- Show AI analysis progress (15/20 complete)
- Update similarity scores in real-time

### **4. Context Window Limitations**
**Problem**: Claude has 200K token limit but 100 projects √ó 500 words = 50K tokens just for descriptions.

**Solution**:
- Truncate descriptions to 300 words
- Analyze top 20 most relevant projects only
- Use concise reasoning format in AI prompts
- Batch processing with smart prioritization
